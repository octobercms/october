# Security Policy

**PLEASE DON'T DISCLOSE SECURITY-RELATED ISSUES PUBLICLY, [SEE BELOW](#reporting-a-vulnerability).**

## Supported Versions

October is evergreen, no one version is singled out for security fixes because there is no way to update just one version. Builds are continually released and security fixes will always be available in the latest build.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within OctoberCMS, please send an email to Luke Towers at octobercms@luketowers.ca and Samuel Georges at hello@octobercms.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.
